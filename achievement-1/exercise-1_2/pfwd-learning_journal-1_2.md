## Exercise 1.2: Data types in python

### Reflection Questions

---

**Imagine you’re having a conversation with a future colleague about whether to use the iPython Shell instead of Python’s default shell. What reasons would you give to explain the benefits of using the iPython Shell over the default one?**

IPython offers syntax highlighting and auto-indentation, making code easier to read and write. It also includes features like tab-completion, object introspection (`?` for help), magic commands (e.g., `%time`), and clearer tracebacks, making it more efficient and user-friendly than the default Python shell.

**Python has a host of different data types that allow you to store and organize information. List 4 examples of data types that Python recognizes, briefly define them, and indicate whether they are scalar or non-scalar.**

**`float` (Floating-Point Number):**

- Represents numbers with a decimal point, or in exponential form.
- Scalar
- Example: `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.5e2` (which is 2.5 x 10² = 250)

  **`tuple`**

- An ordered collection of items, similar to a list. However, tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change their contents once they are created. They are defined by having values between parentheses `()`
- Non-scalar
- Example from your file: `(2008, 6789088686)`

**`dict` (Dictionary)**

- An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are mutable and are used to store data values like a map. They are enclosed in curly braces `{}`
- Non-scalar
- Example: `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`

**`set`**

- An unordered collection of unique items. Sets are mutable, and you can add or remove items from them. They are also enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Any duplicate items are automatically removed.
- Non-scalar
- Example: `{1, 2, "hello"}`

**A frequent question at job interviews for Python developers is: what is the difference between lists and tuples in Python? Write down how you would respond.**

In Python, lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements), while tuples are immutable—you can't change them after creation. Because of this, tuples are often used for fixed data and can be slightly faster and safer than lists in certain situations.

**In the task for this Exercise, you decided what you thought was the most suitable data structure for storing all the information for a recipe. Now, imagine you're creating a language-learning app that helps users memorize vocabulary through flashcards. Users can input vocabulary words, definitions, and their category (noun, verb, etc.) into the flashcards. They can then quiz themselves by flipping through the flashcards. Think about the necessary data types and what would be the most suitable data structure for this language-learning app. Between tuples, lists, and dictionaries, which would you choose? Think about their respective advantages and limitations, and where flexibility might be useful if you were to continue developing the language-learning app beyond vocabulary memorization.**

For the language-learning app, a **list of dictionaries** would be the most suitable data structure.

Each flashcard can be represented as a **dictionary**, where the keys describe the data (`"word"`, `"definition"`, `"category"`). The entire set of flashcards would then be stored in a **list**.

Example:

```python
flashcards = [
    {
        "word": "ephemeral",
        "definition": "Lasting for a very short time.",
        "category": ["adjective"]
    },
    {
        "word": "run",
        "definition": "Move at a speed faster than a walk.",
        "category": ["verb", "noun"]
    }
]
```

Using a list of dictionaries for flashcards offers clarity, flexibility, and extensibility. Accessing values by keys (e.g., card['word']) is more readable and less error-prone than using indexes. Both the list and the dictionaries are mutable, allowing easy updates, additions, or deletions. This structure also supports features like multiple categories per word and can easily be extended with new fields like example sentences or images. In contrast, tuples are immutable and harder to update, while lists of lists are more error-prone and less readable.
