## Exercise 1.5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

### Reflection Questions

---

**In your own words, what is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?**

Object-oriented programming is a way of writing code where we think of things as **objects** — like real-world things. For example, if you’re making a game, you might have objects like a **Player**, **Enemy**, or **Score**. Each object has:

- **Attributes** (also called properties) – things it _has_, like a player's name or health.
- **Methods** – things it _can do_, like move or attack.

We use **classes** to create these objects. A class is like a blueprint, and the object is built from that blueprint.

The benefits of OOP are:

- **Organized code** – It’s easier to group related code together in one place (in a class).
- **Reusability** – You can reuse classes in other programs without rewriting them.
- **Easier to update** – If something changes, you only need to update the class, not every place the object is used.
- **Encapsulation** – You can hide the details of how something works and only show what’s necessary. This keeps things simple and safe.
- **Inheritance** – You can create a new class based on an existing one, saving time and reducing code duplication.

**What are objects and classes in Python? Come up with a real-world example to illustrate how objects and classes work.**

A class is like a blueprint or a recipe. It defines what something is and what it can do. An object is a specific thing made from that class, an instance. It follows the blueprint but has its own unique data.

An example is the samrtphone.

**Class** : Smartphone
This is the **blueprint** for any phone. It defines what every smartphone _has_ (like brand, model, storage) and what it _can do_ (make calls, take photos, send messages).

**Object / Instance**: My iPhone
Each actual phone is a unique object created from the `Smartphone` class. It might have a different brand, color, or amount of storage — but it still works like a phone.

**In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine.**

**Inheritance**
Inheritance allows one class (called a child class or subclass) to take on the features of another class (called the parent class or superclass). It helps us reuse code, organize it better, and avoid repetition.

For example, imagine a Vehicle class with basic features like speed and color. A Car or Bike can inherit from Vehicle, meaning they automatically get all its features. However, they can also have their own unique features, such as the number of doors for a car or the type of handle for a bike.

Inheritance makes programs more flexible and easier to maintain. If we update something in the parent class, the changes automatically apply to all child classes. This saves time and reduces errors when modifying or expanding our code.

**Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows different classes to define their own version of a method with the same name, and the correct version is chosen automatically depending on the object. This makes our code more flexible and easier to extend.

A good example is a payment system. Imagine we're building a shopping app that supports different payment types: Credit Card, PayPal, and Cryptocurrency. Each payment type has a process_payment() method, but it behaves differently depending on the method used.

We could have a PaymentMethod parent class, with subclasses for each type, such as CreditCard or PayPal. All subclasses use the same method name: process_payment(), but each class defines it differently based on how that payment method works. Other parts of the app can simply call the method without needing to know which type of payment is being used — they’ll just get the correct result.

Even though the method name is the same, the behavior changes depending on the object. This is polymorphism in action. It helps us write cleaner, more adaptable code that works with many object types through shared method names.

**Operator Overloading**
Operator overloading lets us customize how Python’s built-in operators (like +, -, ==, and others) behave for our own classes. This means we can define what it means to “add” two objects, compare them for equality, or use other operators in a way that makes sense for our objects.

For example, imagine a class that represents a Book. We can decide what happens when two books are added together — perhaps combining their total number of pages or appending the content of the second book to the first.

By defining these behaviors, operator overloading makes custom objects feel more natural and easier to use, almost like built-in types in the language. It helps write cleaner and more readable code when working with complex data.
