## Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django

### Reflection Questions

---

**Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?**

Using plain Python means we build everything from scratch, giving us full control over the project’s structure and logic. This can be a good choice for small, simple applications that don’t require a lot of built-in features, since we avoid the extra weight of a large framework. However, it can be time-consuming to implement common web development tasks—like routing, database handling, and security—on your own, and we’ll need to ensure performance and scalability without the help of a pre-made system.

Using Django, on the other hand, gives us a complete, “batteries-included” framework that’s implemented in Python. It speeds up development with its Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, follows DRY principles to reduce code repetition, and comes with built-in tools for security, scalability, content delivery, and admin management. This makes it a strong choice for larger, more complex projects that require a backend, database, and robust structure. The trade-offs are that Django enforces its own way of doing things, which can limit flexibility, and it may be overkill for very small or simple applications that don’t need its full set of features.
