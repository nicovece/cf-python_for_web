## Exercise 2.4: Django Views and Templates

### Reflection Questions

---

**Do some research on Django views. In your own words, use an example to explain how Django views work.**

In Django, a view is a core component of the framework’s request–response cycle. A view is responsible for processing an incoming HTTP request, applying the necessary logic, and returning an appropriate HTTP response, which is often an HTML page.

For example, in a blog application, a view might retrieve all blog posts from the database and pass them to a template for presentation. In this process, the view serves as the intermediary between the URL configuration, which routes the request, and the template, which defines the structure of the output.

In summary, Django views separate application logic from presentation, ensuring that data handling and display remain distinct and maintainable.

**Imagine you’re working on a Django web development project, and you anticipate that you’ll have to reuse lots of code in various parts of the project. In this scenario, will you use Django function-based views or class-based views, and why?**

In this scenario, it would be more appropriate to use class-based views (CBVs). Unlike function-based views, which encapsulate all logic within a single function, CBVs organize functionality into reusable classes that can be extended or modified through inheritance. This makes them especially suitable when a project requires repeating similar patterns across multiple views.

By leveraging CBVs, developers can follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. For example, common operations such as displaying lists of objects, showing details, or handling forms can be implemented once in a base class and then reused or extended in other parts of the application.

In summary, class-based views provide a more scalable and reusable approach, making them preferable in projects where code reuse is a priority.

**Read Django’s documentation on the Django template language and make some notes on its basics.**

The **Django Template Language** (DTL) is a system designed to separate the presentation layer from the business logic in a Django application. Its primary purpose is to allow developers to embed dynamic content in HTML while keeping the code organized and maintainable.

At its core, the template language is built around three main elements:

- **Variables**: Denoted by double curly braces (e.g., {{ variable }}), these output dynamic data passed from views into the template.
- **Tags**: Enclosed in {% ... %}, tags control logic within the template, such as loops (for), conditionals (if), or including other templates.
- **Filters**: Used to modify variables before display (e.g., {{ name|upper }} to convert text to uppercase).

DTL also supports template inheritance, which allows developers to define a base template and extend it in child templates. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication across multiple pages.

In summary, the Django Template Language provides a simple yet powerful syntax to manage dynamic content, structure layouts, and encourage maintainable design through separation of concerns.
