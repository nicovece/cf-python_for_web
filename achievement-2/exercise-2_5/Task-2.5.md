# Task 2.5: Recipe Model Changes

## Model from Exercise 2.3

The Recipe model from Exercise 2.3 included the following attributes:

- `recipe_id` (Primary Key)
- `name` (Recipe name)
- `ingredients` (Comma-separated ingredients)
- `cooking_time` (Cooking time in minutes)
- `difficulty` (Difficulty level)
- `likes` (Number of likes)
- `comments` (User comments)
- `references` (Optional reference URL)

## Changes Made Since Exercise 2.3

### 1. Field Modifications

**Difficulty Field:**

- **Change:** Removed `DIFFICULTY_CHOICES` and made the field auto-calculated
- **Reason:** The difficulty is now automatically calculated based on cooking time and number of ingredients, making it more consistent and removing manual input errors

**Readonly Fields:**

- **Change:** Made `difficulty`, `likes`, and `comments` fields readonly (`editable=False`)
- **Reason:** These fields are either auto-calculated or reserved for future features, so they shouldn't be manually editable in forms

### 2. New Fields Added

**Recipe Image:**

- **Added:** `recipe_image` field with image upload capability
- **Reason:** Visual representation of recipes improves user experience and makes the app more engaging

**Short Description:**

- **Added:** `short_description` field (max 300 characters)
- **Reason:** Provides a concise summary of recipes for better display in list views and improved user experience

### 3. Enhanced Functionality

**Auto-calculation:**

- **Enhancement:** Difficulty is now automatically calculated when saving recipes
- **Logic:** Based on cooking time (< 10 minutes vs ≥ 10 minutes) and number of ingredients (< 4 vs ≥ 4)
- **Result:** Four difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Intermediate, Hard

**Validation:**

- **Enhancement:** Added comprehensive validation for required fields
- **Checks:** Ensures recipe name and ingredients are not empty, cooking time is positive

## Current Model Structure

The Recipe model now includes:

- `recipe_id` (Primary Key)
- `name` (Recipe name)
- `short_description` (Brief recipe summary)
- `ingredients` (Comma-separated ingredients)
- `cooking_time` (Cooking time in minutes)
- `difficulty` (Auto-calculated difficulty level)
- `likes` (Number of likes - readonly)
- `comments` (User comments - readonly, future feature)
- `references` (Optional reference URL)
- `recipe_image` (Recipe image with default fallback)

## Summary of Changes

The main changes focus on improving user experience and data integrity:

1. **Visual enhancement** with recipe images
2. **Better information display** with short descriptions
3. **Automated difficulty calculation** for consistency
4. **Protected fields** to prevent data corruption
5. **Enhanced validation** to ensure data quality

These changes make the recipe app more user-friendly and maintainable while preserving all the original functionality from Exercise 2.3.
