## Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python

### Reflection Questions

---

**In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?**

Frontend and backend development can be compared to a restaurant. The frontend is like the waiter—interacting with customers and presenting the menu. It’s what users see and use, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The backend is like the kitchen staff—working behind the scenes to prepare the food. In web development, this means handling data, server logic, authentication, and database communication.

If I were hired for backend programming, I’d work on things like building APIs, managing databases, and ensuring the server supports what the frontend needs.

**Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option?**

Both JavaScript and Python are versatile, high-level languages with strong communities. JavaScript is mainly used for frontend and also works on the backend with Node.js, while Python is known for its clean syntax and is widely used in backend development, especially for tasks involving data or automation.

Without knowing the project's specifics, it's hard to make a definitive choice. However, based on what I’ve learned, I’d lean toward Python for its readability, fast development with frameworks like Django or Flask, and strong support for backend logic and data handling.

**Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?**

- I want to continue learning as much as I can about Python—not just during this course, which would be impossible to cover everything, but throughout my career.
- I aim to gain a solid understanding of a tool that requires a completely new mindset and approach for me.
- Realistically, I see myself working on web-based projects, as that has been my focus for years. However, I hope to dive deeper into software development and eventually move beyond the web to work more on general-purpose software.
